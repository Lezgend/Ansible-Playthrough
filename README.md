# Start the Vagrant VM
```bash
vagrant up
```

```bash
---Output---
Current machine states:

alpine1                   running (virtualbox)
alpine2                   running (virtualbox)
alpine3                   running (virtualbox)
alpine4                   running (virtualbox)

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
